# High priority

## Balancing

Go through each canister and weapon, tweak balancing for:

- damage
- knockback
- explosion size
- damage, knockback, amount of child projectiles created where applicable

## Multiplayer compatibility

Go through basically everything, make sure netcode is correct

Might end up just adding Dave's easy packets mod for custom netcode

# Medium priority

## Visuals and effects

Go through each canister and weapon, tweak visuals:

- Add sounds
- Tweak visuals where they look a bit shit
- Add lighting and glowmasks
- Add some fancy pulsing for colours
- Revisit shooting out of muzzle, it's a bit imprecise

## Internal stuff

Take another look at documentation and internal names/organisation
